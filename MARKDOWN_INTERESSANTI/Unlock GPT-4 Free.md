**Creator teaches you how to use GPT-4 (Including Turbo) for $0**

What Do I Need?

-   You need a userscript manager like [ViolentMonkey 180](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tamper Monkey 126](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) & a userstyles manager like [Stylus 187](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
    
-   You need a userscript: [The Required Userscript 404](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/485618-%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%A9%E6%89%8B-coze-free-gpt4)
    
-   You need a [Google Account 28](https://www.google.com/account/about/) or a [Phone Number 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number)
    

How Does This Work?

-   You need to visit [coze.com 455](http://coze.com/) or [coze.cn 101](http://coze.cn/)  
    
-   You need to get started using google or your phone number  
    
-   After sign up/log in, click on the userscript manager and, in the userscript you installed, tap on the first option until it turns green. You may click the other options if you wish to change the size of the UI

Thank you for this. It really works great!

This is interesting. I don’t know anything about bots but I would love to try it and see what happens. If my awful pc ever decided to work properly, some day… but thanks for this. I have visited the bot website you linked here and having a look at it all. Have a good day!
