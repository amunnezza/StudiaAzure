[Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/) are Azure Resource Manager templates provided by the Azure community.

Some templates provide everything you need to deploy your solution, while others might serve as a starting point for your template. Either way, you can study these templates to learn how to best author and structure your own templates.

-   The README.md file provides an overview of what the template does.
-   The azuredeploy.json file defines the resources that will be deployed.
-   The azuredeploy.parameters.json file provides the values the template needs.
