How the cloud can advance your business strategy depends on your situation. The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing multiple business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

As your organization moves forward in your cloud adoption journey, proper planning is key to your success. Your organization already has technology investments, so you must understand your current state and then develop a prioritization plan for your cloud journey.

In this stage, you focus on two main actions:

-   **Rationalize your digital estate:** Understand the organization's current digital estate to maximize return and minimize risks by running a workload assessment.
-   **Create your cloud adoption plan:** Develop a plan where prioritized workloads are defined and aligned with business outcomes.

TRANSCRIPT
<SPAN style="background:CYAN">Cloud adoption plans convert the aspirational goals of a cloud adoption strategy into an Actionable plan. The collective cloud teams can use the cloud adoption plan to guide their
technical efforts and align them with the business strategy.

When starting out your plan, you should begin with the rationalization of your digital estate. An inventory of your assets is a necessary step, but a full and complete inventory can take a long time, which can delay your cloud adoption.

Treating the rationalization process as a complex decision tree will help you to visualize the processes as each asset in the digital estate results in one of five answers, known as the 5R rehost, refactor, rearchitect, rebuild, and replace.

Making sure that you are relating the business outcomes that you are trying to achieve by utilizing quantitative analysis to drive the first layer of decisions and qualitative analysis to narrow down the specific services that you are trying to move into the cloud, you can make the inventory go much faster and, in many cases, be executed in multiple weeks rather than multiple months.

Industry alignment is key, including the people from youR first project and employees from business, IT, finance, and governance brings together a complete cloud strategy team.

The idea is that the corret cloud strategy team working together will be able to set the right foundations for updating and evolving that initial workload that was moved into the cloud. Remember, understanding what you're looking for is key, whether it is cost management or IT business alignment, is the right time to talk with your new team about what that should be. True organizational alignment takes time and it is important to establish long-term organizational alignment, especially as cloud adoption scales across business and IT culture.

Skill readiness is the number one blocker that we encounter. There are a lot of resources available to assist with enterprise skilling initiative, including offering discounts for business and technical skills, as it is imperative to skill Not only your IT people but also your business people.

Your business people will receive the most out of the cloud adoption, so make sure that they are getting the skills that they need to maximize the value they are expecting to get from the cloud.

Finally, we arrive at the cloud adoption plan, which is where you will align and implement your strategy and planning.

The idea is to make sure you are achieving those business outcomes based on what you are trying to do with the technology. If the business objective is only to move to the cloud, it may take a lot of time and could be a lift and shift project, which will allow the project to rapidly move to the cloud. 
In other cases, you may be looking for more optimization or innovation. Application innovation or data driven innovation, all of this needs to be documented with the right people to begin the Project execution.

## Rationalize your digital estate

A digital estate is the collection of IT assets that power business processes and supporting operations. To begin cloud rationalization of the digital estate, inventory all the digital assets the organization owns today. Then, evaluate each asset to determine the best way to migrate or modernize each component to the cloud.

During this process, we recommend that you proceed incrementally, application by application. Don't make decisions too broadly or too early across the entire application portfolio.

There are five options for cloud rationalization, sometimes referred to as the **Five Rs**:

**Rationalization option**

**Expected business outcome**

![Share](Plan%20-%20Training%20%20Microsoft%20Learn/rehost.png) **Rehost**

Also known as a lift-and-shift migration, a rehost effort moves a current state asset to the chosen cloud provider, with minimal change to overall architecture.

-   Reduce capital expense.
-   Free up datacenter space.
-   Achieve rapid return on investment in the cloud.

![Web design](Plan%20-%20Training%20%20Microsoft%20Learn/refactor.png) **Refactor**

Refactor also refers to the application development process of refactoring code to allow an application to deliver on new business opportunities.

-   Experience faster and shorter updates.
-   Benefit from code portability.
-   Achieve greater cloud efficiency in the areas of resources, speed, cost.

![Playbook](Plan%20-%20Training%20%20Microsoft%20Learn/rearchitect.png) **Rearchitect**

When aging applications aren't compatible with the cloud, they might need to be rearchitected to produce cost and operational efficiencies in the cloud.

-   Gain application scale and agility.
-   Adopt new cloud capabilities more easily.
-   Use a mix of technology stacks.

![Power](Plan%20-%20Training%20%20Microsoft%20Learn/rebuild.png) **Rebuild/New**

Unsupported, misaligned, or out-of-date on-premises applications might be too expensive to carry forward. A new code base with a cloud-native design might be the most appropriate and efficient path.

-   Accelerate innovation.
-   Build applications faster.
-   Reduce operational cost.

![Cloud computing](Plan%20-%20Training%20%20Microsoft%20Learn/replace.png) **Replace**

Sometimes the best approach is to replace the current application with a hosted application that meets all functionality required in the cloud.

-   Standardize around industry best practices.
-   Accelerate adoption of business process-driven approaches.
-   Reallocate development investments into applications that create competitive differentiation or advantages.

## Create your cloud adoption plan

As you develop a business justification model for your organization's cloud journey, identify business outcomes that can be mapped to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach the desired state of transformation. Documenting all these outcomes and business strategies serves as the foundation for your organization's cloud adoption plan.

Key steps to build this plan are to:

-   Review sample business outcomes.
-   Identify the leading metrics that best represent progress toward the identified business outcomes.
-   Establish a financial model that aligns with the outcomes and learning metrics.

Here are the key points from this unit:

-   In the plan stage, there are two major actions: rationalizing your digital estate and creating your cloud adoption plan.
-   In the Plan phase, there are five options for cloud rationalization: rehost, refactor, rearchitect, rebuild/new, and replace. During this process, we recommend that you proceed incrementally.

Let's talk next about how to prepare your organization, your business processes, and your environment for your cloud adoption journey.
