## Scenario

Azure Administrators use tools to interact with the cloud environment and complete such tasks as:

-   Deploying dozens or hundreds of resources at a time.

You must select and use a tooling option. Your choices can include the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure Cloud Shell.

## Skills measured

These administrative tools aren't directly tested on [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104). However, may be used during performance-based testing.
