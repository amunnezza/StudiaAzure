# Describe Azure compute and networking services - Training | Microsoft Learn

> ## Excerpt
> Introduction to Azure compute services (virtual machines, Azure Virtual Desktop, Azure Functions) and networking services (virtual networks, ExpressRoute, DNS, etc.).

---
This module focuses on some of the computer services and networking services available within Azure.

Upon completion of this module, you'll be able to:

-   Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions
-   Describe virtual machine (VM) options, including VMs, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, availability sets, Azure Virtual Desktop
-   Describe resources required for virtual machines
-   Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines
-   Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute
-   Define public and private endpoints
