We just looked at how a business plan aligned to a digital estate rationalization can ensure you know why you'll benefit from moving to the cloud. Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users. Now, let's talk about how to get your organization ready for this journey:

-   **Define skills and support readiness:** Create and implement a skills-readiness plan to:
    -   Address current gaps.
    -   Ensure that IT and business people are ready for the change and the new technologies.
    -   Define support needs.
-   **Create your landing zone:** Set up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications.

TRANSCRIPT
<SPAN STYLE="BACKGROUND:CYAN">
Before you start building and deploying solutions using Azure Services, you need to prepare your environment.
The Azure readiness guide introduces features that help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization. 
The right hierarchy is important and the correct business owner of the project needs to take the lead to organizing resources, managing access, managing costs and billing, planning for Governance, using monitoring and reporting, and tracking product updates so that they can be proactive with change management and will keep the project viable. 
One of the big reasons that cloud migrations fail is because the right readiness guide and Hierarchy is not put into place.

The term landing zone refers to an environment thatâ€™s been provisioned and prepared to host workloads in a cloud environment like Azure. A fully functioning landing zone is the final Deliverable of any iteration of the cloud adoption frameworkâ€™s Ready methodology. The landing zone is going to be a safe space for your deployment. By creating a landing zone, you are creating an infrastructure that will host your digital transformation and will cover the 80-90%
of the common governance capabilities and security that your applications will need in the cloud. You will know that it is going to be safe, secure, and ready to be monitored and wonâ€™t be exposing the organization to risk.
IDs are one of the most important pieces, as limiting access helps control who can access and control resources in your environment. Making sure that you have role-based access control is important to limit any mistakes that could be made by your people who shouldnâ€™t have access and who could accidentally increase usage above your adoption plan.
Subscriptions are very important and aligning subscriptions to the right business unit is equally important. If you want to become agile and scale up or down, youâ€™re going to need to
configure and see the impact of any changes. Making sure you have a controlled growth in the cloud begins with the landing zone, as that helps you focus any costs or budgets and will help you manage invoice and payments.
Azure Blueprints are a great tool to help provide premade samples of policy initiatives. Each sample is production quality and are ready to deploy today to assist in meeting various compliance needs. These blueprints can save a lot of time and will assist in making sure that any policy decisions are not forgotten. </SPAN>

The **Azure readiness guide** introduces features that help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization. Links to sample skills-readiness learning paths on Microsoft Learn and Azure Support are available in the _Summary and resources_ unit at the end of this module.

## Create your landing zone

Before you begin to build and deploy solutions with Azure services, make sure your environment is ready. The term _landing zone_ is used to describe an environment that's provisioned and prepared to host workloads in a cloud environment, such as Azure. A fully functioning landing zone is the final deliverable of any iteration of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure methodology.

_Each landing zone is part of a broader solution for organizing resources across a cloud environment. These resources include management groups, resource groups, and subscriptions. Azure offers many services that help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization's Azure subscription. Microsoft Cost Management + Billing also provides a few ways to help you predict, analyze, and manage costs._

Here are the key points from this unit:

-   Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users.
-   When you define skills and support readiness, create and implement a skills-readiness plan to address current gaps, ensure that people are ready for the change, and define support needs.
-   The process of creating your landing zone sets up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications.

Next, you'll learn about how to implement your cloud adoption plan based on either a migration or innovation path.
